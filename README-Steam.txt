[h2]Q&A[/h2]
[b]Q:[/b] Is this mod political?
[b]A:[/b] No.

[b]Q:[/b] Is this mod apolitical?
[b]A:[/b] Yes.

[b]Q:[/b] The flag of country [i]X[/i] offends me, what should I do?
[b]A:[/b] You can simply delete the flag from your local files. Alternatively, you can replace the flag with a copy of "(Bob-AT)Redacted_A.png".

[b]Q:[/b] The flag of country [i]X[/i] appears to be stretched/deformed?
[b]A:[/b] Patches for GROUND BRANCH need to be exactly 512x256. The aspect ratio is 2:1.
For some flags, this does not work well. Please provide an aspect-ratio correction transformation via
GitHub ticket. See [i]README[/i] on GitHub for how such transformations work. 
Alternatively, you can provide a 512x256 PNG file in the ticket.

[b]Q:[/b] Can I use the scripts to generate other patches?
[b]A:[/b] Yes, of course.

[b]Q:[/b] I have another issue.
